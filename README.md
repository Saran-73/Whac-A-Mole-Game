## Overview
  To-do-list app built with javascript that will create new tasks, with checkbox to checkmark the completed task and the users data is stored in LocalStorage.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- create new tasks and delete the completed ones.
- Data should be stored in local storage so we dont lose the data when the page reloads.
